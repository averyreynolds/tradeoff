## **Vision:**
> A competitive, educational trading app with data visualization and financial modeling tools primarily in Python.
### Tentative Tech Stack:
| **Layer** | **Tool** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Backend | FastAPI |
| Finance API | yfinance |
| Logic | Python |
| Frontend | HTML/CSS |
| Database | SQLite |
### Current Progress/Features:
1. Define data structure for portfolio, some test tickers, set up FastAPI project + git repo
2. Import 'yfinance', write pandas function: ticker list + weights -> return
3. Show input form (ticker + allocation), display user portfolios, and compare returns
4. UI (HTML/CSS), each holding in user portfolio in a gridview.
### Reflections:
- (7/15): Currently, my project has a functioning backend that updates with live market data to show current portfolio value and gains/losses. Going into this project I had an introductory understanding of basic data structures and object-oriented programming in Python. The past month taught me so much primarily about API's, database management, and rudimentary frontend development with JS/CSS. I still find myself confused sometimes on how different levels of my program interact to produce the functional UI that I currently have. But, the greatest lesson I've learned to this point is that programming projects often leave you in the complete unknown when new challenges arise and that's 100% part of the learning process.
- (7/15): LOL also just tried to commmit my frontend code and completely lost the file... so will be rebuilding :(
